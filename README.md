# Machine Learning for Site Adaptation

## About

This repository contains the work developed by Narvaez, G, et al. in *Machine learning for site-adaptation and solar
radiation forecasting* [1]. Here is shown the site adaptation process for a database in situ with data of a station
located in Nari√±o, Colombia.

## Work Environment
