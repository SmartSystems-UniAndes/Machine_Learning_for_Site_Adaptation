# Machine Learning for Site Adaptation

## About

This repository contains the work developed by Narvaez, G, et al. in *Machine learning for site-adaptation and solar
radiation forecasting* [1]. The following shows the site adaptation process for an on-site database with data from a
station located in Nari√±o, Colombia.

## Work Environment

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## How it works?

All the project development is self content in the [*Site_Adaptation_Regression_Models.ipynb*](Site_Adaptation_Regression_Models.ipynb) notebook, feel free if you want to modify some parameters and run different train experiments.
